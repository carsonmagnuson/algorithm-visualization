# Tools Used:
Svelte + TS + Vite

# Aim:
The idea behind this project was to create intuitive visualizations of how data is organized, tagged and processed by various sorting and path-finding algorithms to better understand how they work from a ground-up perspective.

# Currently Implemented:
Bubble Sort √

Merge Sort 0.5√

Depth-First Search

Breadth First Search

Minimum Spanning Tree

Dijkstra's Algorithm

A* Algorithm

# Additional Notes:
Currently to play around with this you have to pull it, have node and vite installed and then run it via 'npm run dev'. A more accessable home is in the works, a link to which will replace this section in the future.
